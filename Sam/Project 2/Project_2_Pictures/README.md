# Pictures
My apologies here, there are some duplicates of the same things. If the files have the same name but different prefixes (1A vs 1B vs 1), they're the same thing.

The pictures in here that were not included in the report are pictures 7, 8, and 9 (they all end with NONINTERACTING). These are screenshots of the code output for a specific case (M = 8x8, p_max = 7, I believe). I included them to show the main diagonal eigenvalues agreeing completely with the Armadillo eigenvalues, which I mention in the report.
