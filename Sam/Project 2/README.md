# Project 2

My report is "Project_2_Report.pdf".

The folders "Project_2_Interacting", "Project_2_NonInteracting", and "Project_2_Unit_Test" contain the .cpp files that run the code.

The folder "Project_2_Pictures" contains all of the pseudo-code and other figures seen in the report, along with a few others.

"Wavefunction Plots.ipynb" is the iPython notebook that creates the graph in my report.
